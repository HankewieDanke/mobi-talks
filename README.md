# Heidelberg Molecular Biotechnology M.Sc. Scientific Talk Summary Template

This template is intended to provide an easy starting point for students of the Molecular Biotechnology master's programme at Heidelberg University to start writing their talk summaries. It provides a nice way of color-coding summaries by their main subject (one of "Wirkstoffforschung" (wifo), "Bioinformatik" (info) or "Biophysikalische Chemie" (bpc)).

Usage of the template is simple. Simply populate your `talks` folder with the your summaries, and `\include` those talks in the main body of the document given by `main.tex`. The three files in `talks` provide examples of the information you have to include for each talk. Styling and table-of-contents generation is handled automatically. To adjust your personal information, simply edit the definitions of `\myname`, etc. in `main.tex`. To attach you "Laufzettel" and screenshots of talks, simply assemble them into a PDF file and save them as `rattenschwanz/rattenschwanz.pdf`. To use a digital signature, generate a PNG of your signature and save it as `rattenschwanz/unterschrift.png`.

Hopefully, this template can make this part of the MoBi master's programme a bit more fun and a bit less painful for you.
